"""Master pipeline run record.

Tracks the complete state of a single pipeline execution from work item ingestion
through to merge or failure. Written and updated exclusively by the Orchestrator.
All other agents receive a read-only copy for context but never mutate it directly.

PipelineRun and AgentRunRecord are intentionally mutable (frozen=False) because
the Orchestrator updates them in place as each phase completes.
